Hello Earthlings!

I like learning how to use GitHub and eating dessert.

Tonight I had a homemade dessert called nice cream made by Perla. She says it's made with all vegan ingredients, including bananas, chocolate, and a little bit of almond milk to mix it. The bananas should be frozen and cut into pieces. Using a food processor, combine the banana with cocoa powder and almond milk. You can eat it right away, or place the nice cream in a container and into the freezer.
